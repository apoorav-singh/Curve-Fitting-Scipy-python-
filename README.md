# Gaussian Fitting Code using Scipy
 This is a generic gaussian fit code done using Scipy. This piece of code is inspired by the the code repository: https://gist.github.com/cpascual/a03d0d49ddd2c87d7e84b9f4ad2df466
 
 This code is worked out on Jupyter notbook, where LaTeX inline is used to print the obtained parameters in scientific format.
